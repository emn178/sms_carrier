Description:
============
    Stubs out a new carrier and its views. Passes the carrier name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of emails as arguments.

    This generates a carrier class in app/carriers and invokes your template
    engine and test framework generators.

Example:
========
    rails generate carrier Notifications signup forgot_password invoice

    creates a Notifications carrier class and test:
        Carrier:     app/carriers/notifications_carrier.rb
        Test:        test/carriers/notifications_carrier_test.rb
        Rspec:       spec/carriers/notifications_carrier_spec.rb
